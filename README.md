# Evaluating-Health-Risk-During-Pregnancy---R--Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Employed two logistic regression models, including the “age” variable as a potential confounder, and conducted statistical assessments on these models to further explore the relationship on the level of health risk. 

Successfully implemented R packages (dplyr, ggplot2, tidyverse, pROC, corrplot) to successfully perform hypothesis testing/predictive analysis on a dataset regarding maternal health risk during pregnancy. 
Employed two logistic regression models, including the “age” variable as a potential confounder, and conducted statistical assessments on these models to further explore the relationship on the level of health risk. 
Findings revealed that elevated blood glucose and blood pressure levels accounting for age as a confounder has an inverse correlation with Maternal Health Risk as suggested by the model’s intercept coefficients.
